The ISS (International Space Station) has a radio and its crew sometimes  uses to communicate with amateur radio operators and also, from time to time, to send images back to Earth!

The format they use is called [SSTV (Slow Scan television)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television), in particular its format PD120. It takes around 2 minutes to receive a full image. And you can receive this images yourself by using a small handheld radio.

## How to do it

This is the image I was able to capture. Not to bad for something hundreds of kilometers away!

The downlink of the ISS is located at *145.800 MHz*. I used a web to check when a pass nearby my location would happen. You are going to get a better signal if the max altitude is larger than 10Â°. Also, it doesn't matter if it's visible or not, since we are not interested in seeing it with our naked eye.

I used www.n2yo.com, but there are plenty of pages and apps with this information.

Here is an example of the path I used, from another app called SatSat:

I set the squelch of my Baofeng to 0, and then at the AOS time I started recording with my iPhone voice memos app. I had to move around to try to find the best orientation of the antenna, but eventually I found the transmission noise (you can see how it sounds and check that your SSTV decoding app works [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4UhlByFyw)).

Then I simply came back to my car, played the recording back to my MacBook runnin [MultiScan 3B](https://www.qsl.net/kd6cji/), and this image was decoded.

I'd say this is the bare minimum. You can also try to input the radio audio directlly into your computer, or phone, but I didn't have the connectros needed to do this.

Transmissions will continue until Jan 1st 18:20 UTC.
