I've been attending the woodworking classes at Palo Alto High School for the last couple of years. This was my last project for the 2019 Spring term.

It's a craftsman style mantel clock (~15' tall). I used white oak and sligthly stained it at the end. I also applied a coat of wax. The clock face is made of cedar.

It was a very technical but rewarding project. All the parts had to be carefully milled and measured to make sure they fit perfectly with each other. The picture doesn't show it, but the top is beveled. It took me a couple of pieces of wood to get that right!
