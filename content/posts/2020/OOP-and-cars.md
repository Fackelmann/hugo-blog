When I first learned Object Oriented Programming (OOP) a few years ago the book I was reading had a strange obsession with cars. 

Imagine you have a car, it said. A car is composed of a body, four tires, and an engine. Furthermore, you can have a Ferrari, which is a specific type of car, or you could build cars with different types of wheels. This is the way it explained the concepts of Polymorfism, Inheritance, Composition, and Instantiation. With cars.

I came from a background in C, a procedural programming language, where everything is structured around procedures and procedure calls. And I was utterly confused.

Was the concept of OOP what was confusing to me? It was different, for sure, but I don't think that's the main reason. The main reason was that it was so focused on *CARS*. This was a book that presupposed some programming background; cars is how I would explain OOP to my parents, who have no programming experience, but I think in this case it was detrimental to my understanding. Give me a real world example (dumbed down, if you want); explain to me how you would implement a GUI using OOP so I can see how it differs of the procedural paradigm.

This approach seems to be very common. Just look for ["object oriented programming car"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=object+oriented+programming+car&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images) on your favorite search engine, and you will be presented with a multitude of diagrams showing all the attributes you could assign to a car. Or try to understand the [Builder pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) and you will be presented with a, literal, house builder.

One book that approached this issue in a way I liked is the famous [Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/). The second chapter is a whole case study on how to apply design patterns to a specific problem, a WYSIWYG document editor. To me, this makes understanding how and when to use these design patterns easier and more clear. I can understand *why* you would want to take that approach, *how* you would do it, and some of the consequences of using that pattern.

Can we forget about cars?
